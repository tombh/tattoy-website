## Zola

The Tattoy website is built using the Zola static site engine.

To check out any local changes you've made:

1. [Install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
2. Clone the Tattoy Website git repo and enter that directory:
   1. `git clone https://github.com/tombh/tattoy-website.git`
   2. `cd tattoy-website`
3. Start the Zola server with `zola serve`.

A local server should start and you should be able to access a local version of the website from there.
